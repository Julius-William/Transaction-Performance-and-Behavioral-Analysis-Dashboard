# Transaction Performance & Behavioral Analysis Dashboard

## Background

With the increasing adoption of digital transactions, the financial technology industry has experienced significant growth over the past few years. The rise of online payments, debit and credit card usage, and digital banking services has transformed how customers interact with financial institutions.

As transaction volumes continue to grow, understanding transaction patterns, customer behavior, and payment preferences becomes increasingly important. Companies must leverage data to monitor performance trends, identify seasonal patterns, and understand demographic differences in spending behavior.

Through data analysis and visualization, businesses can gain actionable insights to support strategic decision-making and optimize overall transaction performance.
